# Water Sensor Fault Prediction Project

## Overview
The Water Sensor Fault Prediction project aims to automate the detection of faulty wafers used in the manufacturing of solar cells. Wafers serve as the foundation for microelectronic devices and undergo various fabrication processes. Identifying faulty wafers is crucial to prevent disruptions in the photovoltaic power generation process.

## Problem Statement
- **Data**: Wafers data collected from remote locations.
- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a wafer is faulty or not.
- **Challenges**: Avoid false negatives (misclassifying a faulty wafer as non-faulty) to minimize waste of time, manpower, and costs.

## Dataset Description
- Wafers consist of hundreds of sensors.
- Data from various microfabrication processes (doping, ion implantation, etching, etc.).
- Each wafer is labeled as faulty or non-faulty.

## Project Structure
1. `data/`: Contains the wafer dataset (e.g., `wafer_data.csv`).
2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
3. `models/`: Trained machine learning models (e.g., `random_forest_model.pkl`).
4. `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Explore the data using the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Train a classification model (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) to predict wafer faults.
5. Evaluate the model's performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Usage
1. Load the wafer dataset (`wafer_data.csv`) using the provided Python script.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features, etc.).
3. Train a classification model using the processed data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.
5. Save the trained model for future predictions.
